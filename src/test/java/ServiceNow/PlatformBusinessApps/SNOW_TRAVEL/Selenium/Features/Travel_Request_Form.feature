    Given I am a authenticated Travel Request User under the DOC CGH
    When I am on the "Travel Planning System" Portal form
#    When I am completing the Travel Planning System form,
#    Then I will not see the Header on the form "Travel Cash Advance",
#    And the following fields under "Travel Cash Advance" section will be removed:
#      """
#      Cash (Direct Deposit) Advance Requested
#      Reason for Cash Advance
#      """

About Research Plus Data Access
To request access to the Research Plus Data, you must login with an eRA Commons account that is associated with an institutional email address (.edu, .gov, .org, or work email address) for user authentication.
Requestors associated with HHS agencies should login with their PIV cards to request the data.
Information on how to obtain an eRA commons login can be found in the FAQ on the SEER webpage.
Users who are approved for access to the SEER Research Plus Databases will be eligible to request specialized databases.

About Research Data Access
If you cannot obtain an eRA Commons account or do not need access to the additional variables available in the Research Plus Data, you can register for the Research Data.
Users with access only to the Research Data are not eligible to request specialized databases and cannot upgrade to Research Plus without an eRA Commons account or an HHS PIV card.

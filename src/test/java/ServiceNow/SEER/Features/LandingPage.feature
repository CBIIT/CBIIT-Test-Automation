  Scenario: Verifying Request Database Access text

    Then the "Request Database Access" text displays as
      """
      Request Database Access
      To request access to the SEER Incidence Databases, you will need to create a new SEER*Stat account by registering. For immediate access to the SEER Research Plus Databases, you will need to register with your eRA Commons credentials using the Institutional Account Login. If you do not have an eRA commons login and are not affiliated with an Institute, you will need to use the Non-Institutional Account, and will receive access to the SEER Research Database.
      If you are affiliated with an Institute and have an institutional email account (.edu, .gov, .org), you must use your eRA Commons credentials to request the SEER data.
      Existing SEER*Stat account holders can upgrade access to the Research Plus Databases by logging in with your SEER*Stat Username and registered email address.
      Only users who have already used this system to request a new, non-Institutional account can upgrade an existing account. All other users should follow steps to create a new account.
